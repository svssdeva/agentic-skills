# Research Campaign Spec

## Purpose

Use `research_campaign.json` or `research_campaign.yaml` when `ai-research-explore` is operating as Rigor Explore:

- the task family is already chosen
- the dataset is already chosen
- the evaluation method is already chosen
- the provided SOTA table is already frozen by the researcher
- the remaining work is campaign governance, implementation, and candidate filtering

This file is an advanced reference. The public entrypoint only requires the
campaign core to be frozen; the detailed blocks below are guidance for richer
campaigns, not fields the agent must invent on every run.

`variant_spec` still exists, but it is now an optional run-level part of a
larger campaign.

Rigor Explore treats novelty as a candidate hypothesis. Novelty and
significance remain hypotheses until supported by literature contrast, ablation
evidence, and fair comparison.

## Minimal Shape

```json
{
  "current_research": "seg-branch@abc1234",
  "task_family": "segmentation",
  "dataset": "DemoSeg",
  "benchmark": {
    "name": "DemoBench",
    "primary_metric": "miou",
    "metric_goal": "maximize"
  },
  "evaluation_source": {
    "command": "python eval.py --config configs/demo.yaml",
    "path": "eval.py",
    "primary_metric": "miou",
    "metric_goal": "maximize"
  },
  "sota_reference": [
    {
      "name": "Provided SOTA",
      "metric": "miou",
      "value": 80.0,
      "source": "paper-or-table-url"
    }
  ],
  "compute_budget": {
    "max_runtime_hours": 8
  }
}
```

## Durable Core Fields

- `current_research`
  Durable anchor for the current research state.
- `task_family`
  The already-chosen task family, such as `segmentation`, `classification`, or `depth`.
- `dataset`
  The dataset name used for this campaign.
- `benchmark`
  The benchmark name or descriptor. A dictionary may also carry `primary_metric` and `metric_goal`.
- `evaluation_source`
  The frozen evaluation contract input. Prefer a command plus an optional path.
- `sota_reference`
  The user-provided comparison table. `ai-research-explore` treats this as authoritative input and does not prove completeness.
- `compute_budget`
  The bounded resource envelope for candidate-only work.

## Optional Guidance Fields

- `candidate_ideas`
  Preferred but optional candidate directions that the researcher already wants to consider. If omitted, or if `idea_generation.allow_synthesized_seed_ideas` stays enabled, the orchestrator may add a small number of conservative single-variable seed ideas.
- `variant_spec`
  Optional run-level candidate matrix used by `explore-run`.

Optional top-level fields:

- `baseline_gate`
- `execution_policy`
- `research_lookup`
- `idea_policy`
- `idea_generation`
- `source_constraints`
- `feasibility_policy`

## `evaluation_source`

Supported fields:

- `command`
- `path`
- `primary_metric`
- `metric_goal`
- `execution_kind`
- `artifacts`
- `notes`
- `split`

This block feeds both:

- `analysis_outputs/EVAL_CONTRACT.md`
- the baseline gate

## `sota_reference`

Each item should preferably contain:

- `name`
- `metric`
- `value`

Optional fields:

- `source`
- `notes`
- `metric_goal`

This is a frozen comparison set for the campaign. It is not a guarantee that the real global SOTA has been fully covered.

## `candidate_ideas`

Each item should contain:

- `id`
- `summary`
- `change_scope`
- `target_component`
- `expected_upside`
- `implementation_risk`
- `eval_risk`
- `rollback_ease`
- `estimated_runtime_cost`
- `single_variable_fit`

Optional fields:

- `hypothesis`
- `supporting_changes`

The orchestrator uses these to run the idea gate. It does not treat them as novelty claims. When a researcher idea passes hard gates, final selection stays inside the researcher pool even if synthesized or hybrid ideas are also present for auditability.

## Optional Policy Blocks

### `research_lookup`

Use this block to seed auditable lookup records without turning the orchestrator into an open-ended research agent.

Supported fields:

- `source_preference`
- `local_literature`
- `queries`
- `seed_sources`
- `enable_repo_local_extraction`
- `optional_providers`

Rigor Explore may prefer local literature context first, including Zotero,
if available. Local literature should be treated as curated prior knowledge. If
local literature is unavailable or too sparse, bounded web/source lookup may be
used. Zotero-first is a source lookup strategy, not a separate main skill. It
should support meaningful and potentially novel idea generation, not become a
generic literature search tool.

Example future-compatible lookup hint:

```yaml
research_lookup:
  source_preference:
    - local_literature
    - seed_sources
    - repo_local
    - public_locators
    - optional_web
  local_literature:
    enabled: auto
    provider: zotero
    fallback_to_web_when:
      - unavailable
      - too_sparse
      - insufficient_candidate_coverage
```

All lookup artifacts are cached into `sources/` with stable names, `sources/records/`, and an `index.json`. Missing optional provider keys, including Zotero, must not block this pass.

### `idea_policy`

Optional governance hints for idea selection. Current implementations keep hard gates fixed and treat policy hints as future-compatible metadata.

Suggested fields:

- `max_patch_surface`
- `max_dependency_drag`
- `require_source_backing`

### `idea_generation`

Optional hints for bounded idea-space expansion. This block is additive; it should not break the minimal campaign shape.

Supported fields:

- `allow_synthesized_seed_ideas`
- `max_generated_ideas`
- `require_diverse_targets`

Default behavior keeps generation conservative:

- prefer single-variable ideas
- do not modify the frozen eval contract
- do not jump directly to broad architecture rewrites
- keep synthesized ideas bounded to repo-local components, existing variant axes, or lookup-backed source hints
- bind each generated seed to `current_research`, `task_family`, `dataset`, and `evaluation_source` in `IDEA_SEEDS.json`

### `source_constraints`

Optional hints for transplant scope.

Suggested fields:

- `preferred_repos`
- `forbidden_paths`
- `protected_zones`

### `feasibility_policy`

Optional hints for bounded execution.

Suggested fields:

- `prefer_short_run_only`
- `require_gpu`
- `max_short_run_hours`

## Gates

### Baseline gate

Default rules:

- `maximize`: abandon if baseline trails provided SOTA by more than `2.0` absolute points
- `minimize`: abandon if baseline is worse than provided SOTA by more than `5%`

The gate can return:

- `proceed`
- `borderline`
- `abandon`
- `not-applicable`

### Idea gate

Hard gates:

- `baseline_gate != abandon`
- `single_variable_fit >= 0.6`
- `interface_fit >= 0.5`
- `patch_surface <= 0.7`
- `dependency_drag <= 0.7`
- `eval_risk <= 0.6`
- `short_run_feasibility != blocked`

Soft ranking combines:

- `expected_upside`
- `single_variable_fit`
- `groundedness`
- `novelty_estimate`
- `interface_fit`
- `rollback_ease`
- `source_support_strength`
- `ablation_clarity`
- `implementation_story_clarity`
- `implementation_risk`
- `eval_risk`
- `estimated_runtime_cost`
- `patch_surface`
- `dependency_drag`
- `baseline_distance`

`IDEA_SCORES.json` records both raw inputs and explicit score breakdowns. If the active top-two ideas are too close, `ai-research-explore` records a human checkpoint instead of silently training.

If the selected idea cannot be decomposed into implementable atomic units, `ai-research-explore` records an explicit blocker/checkpoint such as `atomic-decomposition-blocked` and stops before broader implementation or execution.

## Output Expectations

The following artifacts are the full advanced campaign surface. A minimal
campaign should produce only the files justified by the active work; do not
inflate the run with empty artifacts just to satisfy this list.

Campaign mode writes:

- `analysis_outputs/RESEARCH_MAP.md`
- `analysis_outputs/CHANGE_MAP.md`
- `analysis_outputs/EVAL_CONTRACT.md`
- `analysis_outputs/SOURCE_INVENTORY.md`
- `analysis_outputs/SOURCE_SUPPORT.json`
- `analysis_outputs/IMPROVEMENT_BANK.md`
- `analysis_outputs/IDEA_CARDS.json`
- `analysis_outputs/IDEA_SEEDS.json`
- `analysis_outputs/IDEA_EVALUATION.md`
- `analysis_outputs/IDEA_SCORES.json`
- `analysis_outputs/MODULE_CANDIDATES.md`
- `analysis_outputs/INTERFACE_DIFF.md`
- `analysis_outputs/ATOMIC_IDEA_MAP.md`
- `analysis_outputs/ATOMIC_IDEA_MAP.json`
- `analysis_outputs/IMPLEMENTATION_FIDELITY.md`
- `analysis_outputs/IMPLEMENTATION_FIDELITY.json`
- `analysis_outputs/RESOURCE_PLAN.md`
- `analysis_outputs/status.json`
- `sources/index.json`
- `sources/SUMMARY.md`
- `sources/records/`
- `explore_outputs/CHANGESET.md`
- `explore_outputs/IDEA_GATE.md`
- `explore_outputs/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`
- `explore_outputs/EXPERIMENT_MANIFEST.md`
- `explore_outputs/EXPERIMENT_LEDGER.md`
- `explore_outputs/TRANSPLANT_SMOKE_REPORT.md`
- `explore_outputs/TOP_RUNS.md`
- `explore_outputs/status.json`

## Notes

- Keep idea generation bounded and auditable rather than open-ended.
- Keep evaluation and SOTA inputs human-frozen.
- `IDEA_SEEDS.json` should expose per-seed bindings such as `context_anchor`, `task_family_binding`, `dataset_binding`, `evaluation_binding`, and `constraint_notes`.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_FIDELITY.json` should separate `planned_implementation_sites`, `heuristic_implementation_sites`, and `observed_implementation_sites`, and should record `verification_level` as one of `not_checked`, `planned_only`, `heuristic_only`, `executor_observed`, or `diff_verified`.
- Let `ai-research-explore` focus on understanding, gating, implementation planning, controlled execution, and comparison.
