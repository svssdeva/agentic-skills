# Caveman Compress

## Purpose

Compress natural language files (CLAUDE.md, todos, preferences) into caveman-speak to reduce input tokens. Compressed version overwrites original. Human-readable backup saved as `<filename>.original.md`.

## Trigger

`/caveman-compress <filepath>` or when user asks to compress a memory file.

## Process

1. The compression scripts live in `scripts/` (adjacent to this SKILL.md). If the path is not immediately available, search for `scripts/__main__.py` next to this SKILL.md.

2. From the directory containing this SKILL.md, run:

```bash
python3 -m scripts <absolute_filepath>
```

3. The CLI will:
- detect file type (no tokens)
- call Claude to compress
- validate output (no tokens)
- if errors: cherry-pick fix with Claude (targeted fixes only, no recompression)
- retry up to 2 times
- if still failing after 2 retries: report error to user, leave original file untouched

## Compression Rules

### Remove
- Articles: a, an, the
- Filler: just, really, basically, actually, simply, essentially, generally
- Pleasantries: "sure", "certainly", "of course", "happy to", "I'd recommend"
- Hedging: "it might be worth", "you could consider", "it would be good to"
- Redundant phrasing: "in order to" → "to", "make sure to" → "ensure"
- Connective fluff: "however", "furthermore", "additionally", "in addition"

### Preserve EXACTLY (never modify)
- Code blocks (fenced ``` and indented)
- Inline code (`backtick content`)
- URLs and links
- File paths
- Commands (`npm install`, `git commit`, `docker build`)
- Technical terms, proper nouns, dates, version numbers, env vars

### Preserve Structure
- All markdown headings
- Bullet point hierarchy
- Numbered lists, tables, frontmatter/YAML

### Compress
- Short synonyms: "big" not "extensive", "fix" not "implement a solution for"
- Fragments OK
- Drop "you should", "make sure to", "remember to"
- Merge redundant bullets that say the same thing differently

**CRITICAL RULE:** Anything inside ``` ... ``` must be copied EXACTLY. Inline code (`...`) must be preserved EXACTLY.

## Pattern

Original:
> You should always make sure to run the test suite before pushing any changes to the main branch. This is important because it helps catch bugs early.

Compressed:
> Run tests before push to main. Catch bugs early.

## Boundaries

- ONLY compress natural language files (.md, .txt, .typ, .typst, .tex, extensionless)
- NEVER modify: .py, .js, .ts, .json, .yaml, .yml, .toml, .env, .lock, .css, .html, .xml, .sql, .sh
- If file has mixed content (prose + code), compress ONLY the prose sections
- Original file is backed up as FILE.original.md before overwriting
- Never compress FILE.original.md (skip it)
