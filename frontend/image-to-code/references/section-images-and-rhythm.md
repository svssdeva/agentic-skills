## 18. SECTION IMAGE GENERATION RULE

Inside Codex, treat each section as its own analyzable unit.

If the user asks for:
- a hero only → generate 1 hero image
- 4 sections → generate 4 section images
- 8 sections → generate 8 section images
- 12 sections → generate 12 section images when reasonable

General preference:
- one section = one primary image
- one complex section = one primary image + one or more optional detail images
- one unclear section = regenerate it again as a fresh clean standalone image

This section-first generation rule exists to prevent:
- tiny unreadable text
- tiny buttons
- unclear spacing
- weak extraction quality
- lossy design-to-code translation

## 19. WEBSITE IMAGE SYSTEM RULE

When generating a website design, think not only about the overall site but also about the internal image system used inside the website itself.

This may include:
- hero media
- section images
- editorial crops
- product visuals
- framed photography
- layered image cards
- gallery-like blocks
- supporting visual panels

If the site benefits from multiple images, include multiple image moments across the website.

Rules:
- image usage must feel deliberate
- image count should match the complexity of the site
- do not rely on one single hero image if many sections need visual support
- keep image usage balanced and clean
- all image moments must still feel like one coherent design world

## 20. FIXED MEDIA FRAME RULE

Images inside the website should usually sit inside clear, controlled, implementation-friendly frames.

Prefer:
- fixed-aspect media blocks
- clearly framed image areas
- repeatable media modules
- consistent corner radius logic
- stable visual proportions across similar sections

Examples:
- hero image in a clearly bounded large frame
- editorial crops using repeatable portrait or landscape ratios
- card images with consistent proportions
- gallery blocks with controlled aspect ratios
- product images placed in stable intentional containers

Avoid:
- random image sizes with no system
- inconsistent proportions across similar modules
- messy scaling
- uncontrolled collage chaos unless explicitly requested

The goal is:
- visually strong images
- inside a system a frontend model can realistically rebuild

## 31. SECTION RHYTHM RULE

A high-end site does not feel like the same block repeated forever.

Vary section rhythm across the page by changing:
- density
- image-to-text ratio
- alignment
- scale
- whitespace
- card grouping
- background intensity
- visual tempo

But:
- keep the page coherent
- keep spacing controlled
- avoid random jumps
- keep each section clean enough to analyze well

---

## 32. DENSITY & SPACING DISCIPLINE

Do not make the website too dense.

The page should breathe.

Rules:
- use even section spacing
- keep major section gaps controlled and intentional
- allow negative space to create calmness
- avoid one section feeling cramped while the next feels empty
- smaller sections should still have enough surrounding space
- prefer analyzable generous spacing over compressed compositions
- do not fill every available area with extra UI
- let simplicity do part of the design work

A premium website should feel:
- open
- composed
- balanced
- confident
- breathable

Not:
- cramped
- noisy
- uneven
- overfilled
- visually exhausting

## 34. MULTI-IMAGE CONSISTENCY RULE

For multi-image websites, enforce:
- same brand world
- same type scale logic
- same spacing discipline
- same CTA styling
- same icon mood
- same image treatment
- same tonal language
- same component family

Image 2, 3, or 8 must not drift into a different website.
